ArrayList: A resizable array implementation of the List interface. It allows for fast random access but slow insertions and deletions.
LinkedList: A doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Queue interfaces. It allows for fast insertions and deletions but slower random access compared to ArrayList.
HashSet: An implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table. It does not maintain any order of elements.
LinkedHashSet: A HashSet with a linked list running through it, maintaining insertion order.
TreeSet: An implementation of the Set interface that uses a red-black tree. It maintains elements in sorted order.
HashMap: An implementation of the Map interface that uses a hash table. It does not maintain any order of keys.
LinkedHashMap: A HashMap with a linked list running through it, maintaining insertion order of keys.
TreeMap: An implementation of the Map interface that uses a red-black tree. It maintains keys in sorted order.


A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, which is a data structure used in computer science to organize and manage hierarchical data. It has the following properties that ensure it remains balanced:

Node Coloring: Each node in the tree is colored either red or black.
Root Property: The root of the tree is always black.
Red Node Property: Red nodes cannot have red children (i.e., no two red nodes can be adjacent).
Black Height Property: Every path from a node to its descendant NULL nodes must have the same number of black nodes. This number is called the black height.
Leaf Nodes: All leaf nodes (NULL nodes) are considered black.

The main advantage of a red-black tree is that it ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced,
which means that operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup can be performed in O(log n) time,
where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
This makes red-black trees efficient for use in various data structures and algorithms,
such as associative arrays, priority queues, and in the implementation of certain map and set classes in the Java Collections Framework (e.g., TreeMap and TreeSet).


In Java, both HashSet and TreeSet are implementations of the Set interface, but they are implemented differently to serve different purposes and use cases.
The way you declare and instantiate them can depend on your specific needs and the properties of each implementation:

HashSet:
Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
A HashSet is backed by a hash table (or more specifically, a HashMap). It offers constant time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains, assuming the hash function disperses elements properly.
When you declare a HashSet as a Set, you're using polymorphism to keep your code flexible. This way, you can easily switch to a different Set implementation (like TreeSet or LinkedHashSet) later if needed, without changing the rest of your code.

TreeSet:
TreeSet<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
A TreeSet is backed by a red-black tree, as discussed earlier. It maintains elements in sorted order and provides logarithmic time performance for add, remove, and contains operations.
When you declare a TreeSet specifically as a TreeSet (instead of as a Set), you might be doing so to access methods that are unique to the TreeSet class, such as first(), last(), higher(), lower(), etc., which are not part of the Set interface.

In summary, the choice between using Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>(); and TreeSet<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
depends on whether you need the specific features of a TreeSet (such as ordered elements)
or whether you want to keep your code more generic and flexible by using the Set interface.
If you don't need the specific features of a TreeSet, it's generally a good practice to code to the interface (Set) rather than the implementation (TreeSet).
