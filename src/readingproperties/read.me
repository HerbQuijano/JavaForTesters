import java.io.FileInputStream;
The FileInputStream class is part of the java.io package.
It is used to read data from a file in the form of a sequence of bytes.
In the context of the PropertiesReader class, FileInputStream is used to read the properties file from the file system so that its contents can be loaded into a Properties object.

import java.io.IOException;
The IOException class is also part of the java.io package.
It is a checked exception that represents an input or output operation failure.
In the PropertiesReader class, IOException is used to handle any errors that may occur while reading the properties file, such as if the file does not exist or cannot be accessed.

import java.util.Properties;
The Properties class is part of the java.util package.
It is a subclass of Hashtable and is used to manage a set of key-value pairs.
In the context of the PropertiesReader class, a Properties object is used to load and store the key-value pairs from the properties file.
The load method is used to read the properties from the FileInputStream, and the getProperty method is used to retrieve the value associated with a specific key.


The interaction between these imports in the PropertiesReader class can be summarized as follows:
A FileInputStream is created to read the properties file.
A Properties object is created to hold the key-value pairs from the file.
The load method of the Properties object is called with the FileInputStream as an argument to load the properties from the file.
The getProperty method of the Properties object is used to retrieve the values of specific properties by their keys.
An IOException may be thrown during these operations if there are any issues with reading the file, and it is caught and handled in a catch block.
